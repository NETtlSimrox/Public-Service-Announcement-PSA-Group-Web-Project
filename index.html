                <h3>How to spot text scams</h3>
					<P>Text scams, also called “smishing” scams, are fraudulent messages designed to trick people into sharing personal or financial information. 
						Scammers often impersonate trusted organizations such as banks, delivery services, or government agencies to make the message appear legitimate. 
						One major red flag is an unexpected or unsolicited text asking you to click a link, verify information, or respond quickly. 
						Scammers rely on urgency and fear to pressure victims into acting without thinking. Messages may warn about unpaid tolls, missing packages, 
						or compromised accounts to create panic and encourage quick responses. </P>
					<P>Another common sign of a scam text is the request for sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, passwords, or credit card details. 
						Legitimate companies typically do not ask for this information through text messages. 
						Scam texts may also contain unusual phone numbers, suspicious links, or grammatical errors. 
						In many cases, scammers use fake websites or malware links that look official but are designed to steal data or infect devices. 
					Recognizing these warning signs can help individuals avoid falling victim to fraudulent messages.</P>

                <h3>Examples of what some spam texts may look like</h3>
						<P>Spam texts often mimic everyday services and organizations to appear believable. 
						A common example includes messages claiming to be from a delivery service, such as a package tracking notification requiring action. 
						These texts usually include a link directing users to update shipping details or pay a small fee. 
						However, these links typically lead to fake websites designed to steal personal and financial information. 
						Many legitimate shipping companies do not send unsolicited tracking texts or include links unless the customer initiates the request.</P>
						<P>Another example involves messages about unpaid tolls, traffic tickets, or tax refunds. 
						These texts frequently warn that failing to respond immediately could result in penalties, suspended licenses, or lost refunds. 
						Some scam texts also promise rewards such as free gift cards or prizes but require recipients to click a link or pay a small shipping fee. 
						These messages are often sent by impersonators using well-known brand names or government agencies to increase credibility and encourage users to engage with the scam.</P>

               <h3>How to respond to reciving a text scam</h3>
					<P>If you receive a suspicious text message, experts recommend not responding or clicking any links. 
						Responding to scam messages can confirm that your phone number is active, which may result in receiving additional scams. 
						Instead, individuals should verify the message by contacting the organization directly through official websites or phone numbers. 
						Taking time to confirm information can prevent scams that rely on urgency and quick decision-making.</P>
					<P>People should also report suspicious texts to help prevent others from being targeted. 
						Many organizations suggest forwarding scam messages to 7726 (SPAM), which helps mobile carriers identify and block fraudulent numbers. 
						Additionally, individuals can use their phone’s built-in spam reporting or blocking tools to reduce future scam messages. 
						Reporting and deleting suspicious texts is one of the most effective ways to limit scammers’ reach.</P>

                <h3>What to do if you get scammed</h3>
				<P>If someone interacts with a scam text or shares personal information, it is important to act quickly. 
						Victims should immediately contact their financial institutions to alert them of potential fraud and monitor accounts for unauthorized transactions. 
						In some cases, banks can freeze accounts, cancel cards, or prevent further financial losses. 
						It is also recommended to change passwords and secure accounts that may have been compromised.</P>
					<P>Victims should also report the scam to law enforcement agencies and consumer protection organizations such as the Federal Trade Commission. 
						Reporting helps authorities track scam patterns and warn others about emerging threats. 
						Additionally, individuals should continue monitoring credit reports and phone bills for unusual activity to ensure no additional fraud occurs. 
						Taking these steps can reduce long-term damage and protect personal information.</P>

                <h3>Preemtive measures you can take to avoid being scammed</h3>
                    <P>There are several proactive steps individuals can take to protect themselves from text scams. 
						One important strategy is to avoid clicking links or responding to unexpected messages, even if they appear to come from trusted organizations. 
						Using phone settings or third-party apps to filter and block unknown senders can also reduce exposure to scam messages. 
						Keeping devices and security software updated helps prevent malware and phishing attacks.</P>
					<P>Another preventative measure involves safeguarding personal information. 
						People should treat sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, passwords, and financial information as highly confidential. 
						Regularly reviewing phone bills, bank accounts, and credit reports can help detect suspicious activity early. 
						Remaining cautious, verifying senders, and reporting suspicious messages can significantly reduce the likelihood of falling victim to text scams.</P>
